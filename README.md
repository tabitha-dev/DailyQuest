## üí° About This Project

"My Daily Quest Log!" was created to make daily routines and responsibilities more engaging for children. By framing tasks as "quests" and offering a tangible reward system (stars towards Robux), it aims to motivate kids to complete their chores and learning activities. The application is built with simplicity and interactivity in mind, ensuring a user-friendly experience for young users.

This project showcases fundamental front-end development skills using vanilla JavaScript for logic, Tailwind CSS for modern styling, and leverages local storage for persistent data without needing a backend server.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This interactive to-do list offers several features to keep children motivated:

* **Interactive Task List:** Tasks can be easily marked as complete or incomplete with a simple click, providing immediate visual feedback.

* **Customizable Quests:** Parents or children can add new tasks with custom names and emojis, or remove existing ones, allowing the list to adapt to changing needs.

* **Star Reward System:** Earn a shiny star (üåü) every time all tasks on the list are completed. These stars accumulate over time.

* **Robux Goal Integration:** A clear visual goal of "100 stars to get Robux" is displayed, turning green and showing "Robux earned! üéÆ" once the target is met.

* **Progress Tracking:** A dynamic progress bar visually indicates how close your child is to completing their current daily quests.

* **Fun Sound Effects:**

    * A satisfying "ding" sound plays when an individual task is completed.

    * A classic Mario-like "level complete" sound celebrates when all daily quests are finished.

* **Confetti Celebration:** A burst of colorful confetti accompanies the "Well Done!" pop-up when all tasks are done, adding to the celebratory feel.

* **Local Storage Persistence:** All tasks, their completion status, and earned stars are saved directly in your browser's local storage. This means progress is saved even if the browser is closed, but it is specific to the device and browser being used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Provides the foundational structure of the web page.

* **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for modern, responsive, and utility-first styling.

* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the interactive logic, including:

    * DOM manipulation for task rendering and updates.

    * Event handling for clicks and input.

    * Management of application state (tasks and stars).

* **Tone.js:** A robust web audio framework used to programmatically generate the engaging sound effects without relying on external audio files.

* **`localStorage` API:** Used for client-side data persistence, ensuring tasks and stars are saved across browser sessions on the same device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

No complex build steps are required! Since this is a pure front-end project, you can get it running in seconds.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tabitha-dev/DailyQuest.git](https://github.com/tabitha-dev/DailyQuest.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd DailyQuest
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can do this by simply double-clicking the `index.html` file in your file explorer, or by using a local server extension (like Live Server for VS Code) for a more robust development experience.
